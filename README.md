The Abbey provider is used by security teams and DevOps/DevSecOps engineers to automate and secure
access to sensitive resources in their existing cloud infrastructure.

Resources in this provider interact with endpoints from the Abbey API and needs to be
configured with credentials before it can be used.

## Background

Abbey is a platform for security teams and DevOps/DevSecOps engineers to
automate and secure access to sensitive resources.

With Abbey, you can improve your security and compliance programs by automatically controlling
and right-sizing permissions so the risks around unauthorized access is limited in the event of a breach.

You do this by leveraging your normal Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tooling â€”
Terraform, CI/CD systems, secrets managers, and Terraform wrappers.
Abbey provides a Terraform plugin and platform that extends your Infrastructure as Code capabilities
from Infrastructure to Identity, Access, and Management (IAM).
